# Security

What this platform defends against, how, and where the code and tests for each
defence live. Paths are relative to `apps/cms/` unless they say otherwise.

## Who we defend against

1. **Another client.** Any person in any workspace trying to read or change a
   different client's posts, enquiries, people, keys or settings.
2. **A lower role in the same workspace.** For example, a writer trying to
   publish, read the inbox or change settings.
3. **The public internet.** Visitors of client sites, bots on the contact form,
   people guessing passwords, and anyone holding a stolen or forged token.
4. **Hostile content.** Markup pasted into a post that tries to run script on a
   client's site, or in the admin.
5. **The CMS as a weapon.** Using webhooks to reach internal networks (SSRF), or
   using the contact form to send spam under a client's name.

## Keeping clients apart

Isolation is enforced **twice**: once in the application and once in the database.

- **Application.** Every page and server action resolves the workspace from the
  URL and checks the signed-in user's membership. This is `lib/auth/access.ts`:
  `requireWorkspace`, `actionAccess`. A workspace you are not in is a **404**,
  never a 403, so its existence is not revealed. Every server action is guarded,
  and agency actions additionally require an agency user.
- **Database: row-level security** (`drizzle/0001_rls.sql`).
  - Client content (posts, authors, enquiries, contact rate counters, the audit
    log) is only touched inside `inWorkspace(id, …)` (`lib/db/index.ts`). That runs
    a transaction which sets `app.workspace_id` and switches to the restricted
    role `cms_app`.
  - Policies hide and refuse every row of any other workspace. A query that forgot
    to pin a workspace sees **nothing**, because `NULL` never matches.
  - `cms_app` has no access at all to users, sessions, keys or other system tables.
  - Even a bug in a query cannot cross clients.
- **Media.** Cloudinary files live under `cms/<workspace id>/`. Uploads are signed
  for that folder only. The sanitiser keeps images only from the workspace's own
  folder, and deletes are scoped to it (`lib/cloudinary/`).
- **Site keys** belong to one workspace, and the content API serves only that
  workspace's *published* content. Drafts, scheduled posts, focus keywords, user
  IDs and workspace IDs never appear in API output.

Tests:
- `tests/unit/tenancy.test.ts`: every action across workspaces, RLS checked
  directly, and a query with no workspace pinned.
- `tests/unit/api.test.ts`
- `tests/e2e/2-security.spec.ts`: cross-client URLs in a real browser.

## Roles

`lib/permissions.ts` is the single table every check reads. Writers can only
create posts, and can edit only their own unpublished ones (`canEditPost`).
Nobody can grant a role above their own, and a workspace can never lose its last
owner. Server actions re-check permissions themselves; hiding a button is never
the protection.

Tests: `tests/unit/posts.test.ts`, `tests/unit/tenancy.test.ts`, and the writer
part of `tests/e2e/1-journey.spec.ts`.

## Accounts and sessions

- **Passwords:** bcrypt (cost 12), at least 12 characters, and common
  words/patterns are refused. Unknown emails still run a bcrypt comparison, so
  timing does not reveal who has an account. Errors never say which part was wrong.
- **Rate limits** (`lib/auth/rate-limit.ts`), per 15 minutes: 5 failed sign-ins
  per IP, 10 per account, and 100 across the whole CMS as a brake on distributed
  guessing. A locked account stays locked even for the right password.
- **Sessions** are random 256-bit tokens. Only their SHA-256 is stored. The cookie
  is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` in production. Sessions expire after
  30 days, or after 7 days idle. Signing out deletes the session server-side, so
  a copied cookie stops working (tested end-to-end). Changing or resetting a
  password signs out every other session, and users can see and end their sessions.
- **Two-factor:** an optional emailed 6-digit code, valid for 10 minutes, with 5 tries.
- **Password resets:** single-use links, valid 30 minutes, stored hashed, at most
  5 per machine per 15 minutes. The response is the same whether or not the email
  exists.
- **Invites:** single-use, 7 days, stored hashed, and revocable. Accepting as an
  existing user requires being signed in as that user. No one can sign up without
  an invite.
- **First run:** `/setup` exists only while there are no users. In production it
  also requires `CMS_SETUP_TOKEN`, compared in constant time.

## The admin in the browser

- **CSP with a fresh nonce on every request** (`proxy.ts`): `script-src 'self'
  'nonce-…' 'strict-dynamic'`, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`,
  `form-action 'self'` and `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- Also sent: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `nosniff`, HSTS, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`,
  `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, and `Cache-Control: no-store` on
  every page. There is no `X-Powered-By`.
- Server actions carry Next's built-in Origin check against cross-site requests.
- Uploaded logos are sniffed by content, not by name or type. SVG logos are served
  with `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`, so script inside them never runs.
- The HTML-page editor previews pasted pages in an `<iframe sandbox="">`: no
  script, and an opaque origin.

## Content that reaches client sites

- Every post body is sanitised on save and again on read, by an allow-list
  (`lib/content/sanitize.ts`). Script, event handlers, `javascript:` and `data:`
  URLs, inline CSS expressions, `<base>`, `<meta refresh>`, forms pointing at
  `javascript:` and similar are all removed.
  - Rich-editor posts keep a small set of tags.
  - HTML-page posts keep layout and styling, but never script.
  - The test corpus (`tests/unit/xss-vectors.ts`) has 66 known payloads, tried
    alone, in every pair and through the render-time transforms.
- End-to-end, a post stuffed with payloads is published and opened on the real
  site. The test checks that no dialog fires and no handler survives.
- HTML-page posts are written by editors and owners, and may contain forms and
  external links. Treat publishing rights as you would access to the website itself.

## The content API (`/api/v1/*`)

- Bearer site keys look like `cms_<prefix>_<43 random chars>`. Only the SHA-256
  is stored and the comparison is constant-time. Keys are shown once, can be
  revoked, and stop working immediately.
- Each key is limited to 600 requests per minute.
- No CORS headers, and every response is `Cache-Control: private, no-store`. The
  API is for the client's server, never the browser; the key never reaches a
  visitor.
- Preview tokens are short-lived (15 minutes) signed JWTs bound to one workspace
  and one post. A token for another workspace, or a tampered one, returns 404.
- **Contact submissions** have 32 KB limits and strict field validation. Header
  injection is refused, and topics must come from the configured list. Limits are
  5 per visitor and 60 per workspace per 10 minutes. Visitor IPs are stored only
  as keyed hashes. The site kit's `contactHandler` also refuses cross-site posts
  and fakes success for bots that fill the honeypot.
- The visitor's confirmation email **echoes nothing they typed**, so the form
  cannot be used to send arbitrary text to arbitrary inboxes.
- **CSV export** neutralises formula injection: cells starting with `= + - @`,
  tab or CR are prefixed.

## Webhooks and SSRF

- Each request is signed `x-cms-signature: t=<unix>,v1=<HMAC-SHA256 of t.body>`.
  The site kit's `verifySignature` rejects anything older than 5 minutes, any
  tampering and any wrong secret, comparing in constant time.
- Only agency users can set a webhook URL. In production it must be `https://`
  and resolve to a public address. Private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, multicast
  and cloud-metadata ranges are refused, for IPv4 and IPv6 (including mapped forms).
- That check runs on the URL **and again at connect time**, so DNS rebinding cannot
  change the answer in between (`lib/integrations/net.ts`).
- Redirects are not followed, there is a 5-second timeout, and responses are
  never shown in full.

## Secrets and data

- `CMS_SECRET` signs preview tokens and keys the hashes of visitor IPs. It must
  be 32+ characters; in production, anything that needs it fails loudly
  rather than falling back to a default.
- Webhook secrets and site keys are generated by the CMS.
- No secret is ever sent to the browser except when its owner deliberately reveals
  it, which is an owner/agency action.
- The audit log records, per workspace and inside the same transaction as the
  change: post and author changes, publishing, invites, role changes, removals,
  settings, branding, site keys and webhook secrets. It is kept for a year.

## Dependencies

`npm audit --omit=dev` reports **0 vulnerabilities**. The full audit lists 4
moderate advisories, all in `esbuild` pulled in by `drizzle-kit`. That is a
development-only migration generator; it never runs in production and does not
start the affected dev server.

## Known limits and advice

- Two-factor is by email. If an inbox is compromised, so is the second factor.
  TOTP or passkeys would be stronger.
- Rate limits live in the database, which is fine for a few instances. At very
  large scale, move them to Redis.
- Put the CMS behind a CDN or WAF if you expect hostile traffic. Set
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` to match, or the rate limits key on the proxy's IP.
- Webhook secrets are stored as-is in the database, because the CMS must read
  them to sign each request. Guard database access and backups accordingly;
  passwords, sessions, keys, invites and reset links are all stored only as hashes.
- Without SMTP, emails (with their invite and reset links) are kept in the
  outbox table instead of being sent. Configure SMTP in production.
- Keep `CMS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_WEBHOOKS` and `CMS_SHOW_OUTBOX` off in production.

## Reporting

Found something? Email the agency that runs your CMS. Do not open a public issue.
